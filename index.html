                    There are 2 types of movie fans, the type who got into films in college and tend to enjoy more cerebral films like Citizen Kane & then there are those who lean towards children stories or fantasy.
                    I'm proud to say I fall into the latter. <br> Whether it's that these reelers became synonymous with holidays or because the storylines with animated characters and over the top delivery made them visually and mentally enthralling, they simply made a lifelong impression.</p>

                        The cult classics will probably be: <br><br>
                        Star Wars, Donnie Darko, Sin City and Bad Santa. I can only hope it won't be Zoolander one or two.
