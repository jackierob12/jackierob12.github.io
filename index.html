            <p>There are 2 types of movie fans, the type who got into films in college and tend to enjoy more cerebral films like Citizen Kane & those who lean towards children stories or fantasy. I'm proud to say I fall into the latter. <br /> <br />
            Whether it's that these reelers became synonymous with holidays or because the storylines with animated characters and over the top delivery made them visually and mentally enthralling, the fact is, they simply made a lifelong impression.</p><br />
            
            <p>Modern day classics: What will be the films that kids of today will gather around every year to watch? Or will they view them on their mobile devices while on the fly.<br /> <br /> The cult classics will probably be: Star Wars, Donnie Darko, Sin City and Bad Santa. I can only hope it won't be Zoolander one or two.</p>
